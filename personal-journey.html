        <h1>My Cybersecurity Journey</h1>
        <div class="step">
          <h3>Step 1: Primary School Curiosity</h3>
          <p>I first began introduced when I was around primary school age. I had a keen eye for maths and computers just became 
            something that interested me. I was quickly used by teachers to assist in fixing computers and run assemblies effectively.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <h3><br>Step 2: High School & Digital Tech</h3>
          <p>Joined digital tech class and got hands-on with cybersecurity basics, particularly with Mr Vlad. He's taught me majority 
            of what I know regarding computers and fostered an environment for me that allows me to be curious and want to learn more. 
            The school noticeboard has also been of use assisting me with work experience opportunities and of course EIF which allows 
            me to express my interests regarding cybersecurity more freely and learn more about the field in the process.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
          <h3><br>Step 3: Work Experience Courses</h3>
          <p> So far I've had the pleasure of undertaking two work experience opportunities under the eye of the Australian Government. 
            The first one was more STEM focused at DSTG (Defense Science and Technology group) where I had my first encounter with 
            ethical hacking. This course really started making me consider whether I want to undertake a career in this field under the 
            government. I also have a bit of an interest in Air Force which is where my second work experience course led me. I met with 
            a current Cybersecurity warfare officer and got to ask questions about what his job is like, how he got into his job, and what 
            I can do now as a 15/16 year old kid. From these two courses I then began looking at early opportunities. ADF careers begins 
            recruiting as young as 16, I know I was surprised too, and I would be interested in studying at ADFA (Australian Defense Force 
            Academy) prior to entering a role. This is as far as I have gone, however, as I wish to see where the next two years of schooling 
            leads me and my interests towards.
          </p>

        <div class="step">
          <h3><br>Step 4: The future ahead</h3>
          <p>I have put a little bit of thought into my future but it can be quite daunting. Getting asked the question by my year 10 
            subject counsellor, "What do you want to do for the rest of your life?" shook me, if I'm being honest. School has gone 
            past in a blur and the thought of leaving hadn't really come up for me. All I know is that wherever I go, as long as I enjoy 
            it I will live a happy life.
